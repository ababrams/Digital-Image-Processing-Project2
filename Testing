Program requires directory with three images provided by Dr. Gudivada in them.

Test1:
Execute program without directory passed as argument.

Result: Console output "Directory does not exist or is empty."

Test2:
Execute program with empty directory.

Result: Console output "Directory does not exist or is empty."

Test3:
Execute program with empty directory.

These are only types of tests conducted for program. The rest of the program is self contained and cannot deviate from normal operation if the requirements are meet.
